% OpenDSS fuse object
% This class keeps track of default values for each of the parameters of
% the opendss object, as well as user-assigned parameters, and then can
% pass them on to other objects for use in converting opendss files to
% other formats (see get() ) or can print itself as a char string (see
% char() ) for converting to OpenDSS from other formats.
%
% Generally, for converting to opendss you will want to create one or more
% empty objects and then fill in some values, then export to a text file
% using the char() function.
%
% There are three valid ways to create these objects (specified generically
% so replace 'dssobject' with the class name):
%	dssobject()
%	dssobject(struct)
%	dssobject('prop1',value1,'prop2',value2,...)
%
% The first creates an empty object ready to be filled in
% The second and third populate as many values as possible based on the
% data passed in as arguments or as a struct.  Unknown properties are
% ignored.  Order of properties is not important in the third format.
% Unfortunately, we currently do not support struct arrays or the cell
% array style input that struct() accepts for creating struct arrays.

% The class structure is as follows:
% obj.defaults contains the default values of all the parameters
% obj.data contains user-set values of all parameters
% obj.fieldnames contains the fieldnames of the two structs to save you
% making lots of extra calls.
%
% The concept of this separation of data is that it allows us to present a
% "complete, as opendss would use it" version of the model for converting
% to other formats while only setting the fields we need to explicitly when
% converting TO OpenDSS.
% 
% The question has come up about what to do if there are values we'd like
% to keep in a general conversion utility that don't neatly fit into
% openDSS.  First, make sure they actually don't (openDSS has a lot of
% stuff, and we keep finding ways that it actually does support the
% property we thought it didn't).  The idea I had was to add a third
% sub-struct to hold custom data in some format.  Then modify the 'get' and
% 'set' accessors to use data from it when appropriate.  That way, we can
% continue to maintain separation of data.
%
% When duplicating this class, it should only be necessary to change a few
% methods.  You'll want to change the object defaults below in this file,
% and you'll want to change how the object deals with handling new data in
% the set() function, but that should be about it.  (of course, as you add
% new things, you may also find bugs in various other files that need
% fixing).

% get the class name, for use in various places
cn = mfilename('class');

% that now

		'Like', {''}, ...
		'Action','Close', ... %{Trip/Open | Close}  Action that overrides the Fuse control. Simulates manual control on Fuse "Trip" or "Open" causes the controlled element to open and lock out. "Close" causes the controlled element to close and the Fuse to reset.
		'Delay',0, ... %Fixed delay time (sec) added to Fuse blowing time determined from the TCC curve. Default is 0.0. Used to represent fuse clearing time or any other delay.
		'enabled','Yes', ... %{Yes|No or True|False} Indicates whether this element is enabled.
		'Fusecurve','Tlink', ... %Name of the TCC Curve object that determines the fuse blowing.  Must have been previously defined as a TCC_Curve object. Default is "Tlink". Multiplying the current values in the curve by the "RatedCurrent" value gives the actual current.
		'MonitoredObj','', ... %Full object name of the circuit element, typically a line, transformer, load, or generator, to which the Fuse is connected. This is the "monitored" element. There is no default; must be specified.
		'MonitoredTerm',1, ... %Number of the terminal of the circuit element to which the Fuse is connected. 1 or 2, typically.  Default is 1.
		'RatedCurrent',1, ... %Multiplier or actual phase amps for the phase TCC curve.  Defaults to 1.0.
		'SwitchedObj','', ... %Name of circuit element switch that the Fuse controls. Specify the full object name.Defaults to the same as the Monitored element. This is the "controlled" element.
		'SwitchedTerm',1, ... %Number of the terminal of the controlled element in which the switch is controlled by the Fuse. 1 or 2, typically.  Default is 1.  Assumes all phases of the element have a fuse of this type.
